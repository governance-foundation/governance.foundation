This model provides a high-level structure of how organisational knowledge experiences will contribute information into the model. Its aim is to provid a data model for different purposes that are contributed by different people with different jobs. This can be understood as:

* A business taxonomy
* Governance enabler
* Communication platform
* Knowledge Map
* Single point of information reference
* Conceptual Information model (network taxonomy, multi dimensional, hierarchical and associative categories, NOT “all or nothing”)
* Living, breathing, evolving knowledge foundation

In an organisation, each person will be using a tailored experience suited to their job; doing this will contribute information into a shared knowledge network. This information will part of a knowledge network that will allow information linkage and reuse.
