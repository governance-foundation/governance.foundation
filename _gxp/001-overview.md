Organisations are socio-technical ecosystems that rely on data to make decisions.

GXP will provide a experience ecosystem for organisations that will enhance decision making and make AI and human collarboration possible. This will be done by allowing organisations to gradualy grow into an organisational ontology, with the pace defined by the focus of the organisation.

GXP data platform will provide a source of truth for all organisational information that is used for decision making. This will enable organisations to measure their knowledge depth efficiently, and this will provide an effective method for driving knowledge discovery.

Following pages are focused on providing modelling concepts that will be a foundation of knowledge within an enterprise.

## Why do we need to model

Provide an initial cognitive structure that can be used as an information scaffold when transforming knowledge to information. The model provides a method for sharing knowledge and ability to test the quality of knowledge.

## Definitions

* [Terms](/gxp/diagrams/terms) - definition of terms used.
* [Measurement](/gxp/diagrams/measurement) - how do we measure things.
* [Questions](/gxp/diagrams/questions) - list of questions that would need to be answered by the model.
* [Viewpoints](/gxp/diagrams/viewpoints) - frameworks for viewpoints to present information in the model.
