## System

Without a system, in place, people are not held accountable to mission alignment.

## Vision

A vision is an expression of what the organisation wants to become, what it wants to be, to be known as or to be known for. It is the long-term objective of the organisation.

## Mission

Related:

* Idea - what the organisation pursues and believes in
* Story - a shared narrative about the organisation
* Belief
* Brand - the perspective of organisation sought and perceived
* Ambition

a mission is a quest, a journey to a destination in which the whole organisation is engaged. The mission statement tells us what our goal is â€“ where are we going. It provides a compass setting for the organisation. It is the foundation of effective leadership. It is how the organisation is going to achieve its vision.

## Values

values are the principles or beliefs that will guide the organisation in fulfilling its purpose (achieving its objectives, accomplishing its mission and realising its vision). Values are the things that are important to the organisation.

## Social

Hight Context

* Less verbally explicit communication, less written/formal information
* More internalised understandings of what is communicated
* Multiple cross-cutting ties and intersections with others
* Long term relationships
* Strong boundaries- who is accepted as belonging vs who is considered an "outsider."
* Knowledge is situational, relational.
* Decisions and activities focus around personal face-to-face relationships, often around a central person who has authority.

Low Context

* Rule oriented, people play by external rules
* More knowledge is codified, public, external, and accessible.
* Sequencing, separation--of time, of space, of activities, of relationships
* More interpersonal connections of shorter duration
* Knowledge is more often transferable
* Task-centered. Decisions and activities focus on what needs to be done, division of responsibilities.

The Structure of Relationships

* High:   Dense, intersecting networks and longterm relationships, strong boundaries, relationship more important than task
* Low:   Loose, wide networks, shorter-term, compartmentalised relationships, a task more important than the relationship

Main Type of Cultural Knowledge

* High:  More knowledge is below the waterline--implicit, patterns that are not fully conscious, hard to explain even if you are a member of that culture
* Low:   More knowledge is above the waterline--explicit, consciously organised

## Resource Type

* Stakeholder
  * Government
  * Customer / Customer Segments
  * Community
  * Supplier
  * Investor
  * Employee
  * Regulator
  * Media
  * Partner
  * Competitor
  * Disruptor
  * User
  * Shareholder
  * Local Authority

## Business Architecture

* Strategic Context: The core reason the company exists and its strategic blueprint.
* Business Context: The overall enterprise information that is pertinent to the effectiveness of business architecture.
* Business Capabilities: The business capabilities capture "What" a business does.
* Value Streams: Value streams or Stakeholder Journeys capture the "How" business activities come together to serve the end-to-end needs of stakeholders.
* Data Context: Data is the lifeblood of an organisation and juxtaposing data to other business architecture elements help provide transparency of information flows.
* IT Context: IT enables and powers the business capabilities and value streams and overlay of IT information creates the underpinnings of how capabilities and value streams come to life.

## Knowledge Quality Indicators

* Knowledge Information Quality Indicator (KIQI) provides an ability to understand the quality of information on which decisions are made
* Knowledge Information Contribution Indicator (KICI) provides an ability to understand the individual contribution to shared knowledge
* Knowledge Information Usage Indicator (KIUI) provides an ability to understand how individual contribution is being leveraged from shared knowledge; this will allow tracking and rewarding productised knowledge patterns. This would provide an incentive to productise knowledge for shared knowledge.
