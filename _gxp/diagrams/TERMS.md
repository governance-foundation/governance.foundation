## Vision

a vision is an expression of what the organization wants to become, what it wants to be, to be known as or to be known for. It is the long-term objective of the organization.

## Mission

a mission is a quest, a journey to a destination in which the whole organization is engaged. The mission statement tells us what our goal is – where are we going. It provides the compass setting for the organization. It is the foundation of effective leadership. It is how the organization is going to achieve its vision.

## Social

Hight Context

* Less verbally explicit communication, less written/formal information
* More internalized understandings of what is communicated
* Multiple cross-cutting ties and intersections with others
* Long term relationships
* Strong boundaries- who is accepted as belonging vs who is considered an "outsider"
* Knowledge is situational, relational.
* Decisions and activities focus around personal face-to-face relationships, often around a central person who has authority.

Low Contex

* Rule oriented, people play by external rules
* More knowledge is codified, public, external, and accessible.
* Sequencing, separation--of time, of space, of activities, of relationships
* More interpersonal connections of shorter duration
* Knowledge is more often transferable
* Task-centered. Decisions and activities focus around what needs to be done, division of responsibilities.

The Structure of Relationships

* High:   Dense, intersecting networks and longterm relationships, strong boundaries, relationship more important than task
* Low:   Loose, wide networks, shorter term, compartmentalized relationships, task more important than relationship

Main Type of Cultural Knowledge

* High:  More knowledge is below the waterline--implicit, patterns that are not fully conscious, hard to explain even if you are a member of that culture
* Low:   More knowledge is above the waterline--explicit, consciously organized

## Resource Type

## Business Architecture

* Strategic Context: The core reason the company exists and its strategic blueprint.
* Business Context: The overall enterprise information that is pertinent to the effectiveness of business architecture.
* Business Capabilities: The business capabilities capture “What” a business does.
* Value Streams: Value streams or Stakeholder Journeys capture the “How” business activities come together to serve the end-to-end needs of stakeholders.
* Data Context: Data is the lifeblood of an organization and juxtaposing data to other business architecture elements help provide transparency of information flows.
* IT Context: IT enables and powers the business capabilities and value streams and overlay of IT information creates the underpinnings of how capabilities and value streams come to life.
