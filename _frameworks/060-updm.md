## Description

Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF - UPDM 2.1.1 supports the capability to: - model architectures for a broad range of complex systems, which may include hardware, software, data, personnel, and facility elements; - model consistent architectures for system-of-systems down to lower levels of design and implementation; - model service oriented architectures; - support the analysis, specification, design, and verification of complex systems; and - improve the ability to exchange architecture information among related tools that are UML based and tools that are based on other standards.
