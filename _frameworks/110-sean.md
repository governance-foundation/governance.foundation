## Description

SEON: A Software Engineering Ontology Network - SEON provides a well-grounded network of SE reference ontologies, and mechanisms for deriving and incorporating new integrated domain ontologies into the network.

SEON results from various efforts on building ontologies for the Software Engineering (SE) field. Although SEON itself is a new proposal, the studies and ontologies developed along the years are important contributions for defining this network. Hence, SEON rises with three main premises:

- being based on a well-founded grounding for ontology development;
- offering mechanisms to support building and integrating new SE domain ontologies to the network; and
- promoting integration by keeping a consistent semantics for concepts and relations along the whole network.
