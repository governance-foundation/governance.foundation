## Description

The Ripose technique enables the rapid clarification of your organization's objectives, knowledge and strategies by helping you identify, document and manage three types of information - explicit, tacit and hidden.

Ripose provides the perspective for social-process, and Caspar provides a tool that matches Ripose model with some additional meta-model. Other frameworks provide a process and rely on other tools such as Archimate to do some of it. Some tools have additional analytical functions but that as far as it goes at the moment.

Ripose/Caspar is an iformation system into which you enter a bunch of information, and it creates a report for consumption. Caspar compiler is a database that contains all of the infromation captured using Ripose cycles. Capert is the application logic layer that implements the Ripose process perspective. Casper has predefined information model that is used as a base for analysis.

## Artifacts

* [TheRightAndWrongWays.pdf](/assets/frameworks/ripose/TheRightAndWrongWays.pdf) - Extensive demonstration of mapping Ripose to other frameworks and highlight the number of differences.

* [KnowledgeManagement.pdf](/assets/frameworks/ripose/KnowledgeManagement.pdf) - Knowledge as a subset of information and superset of data. Even this explanation [Knowledge management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information of an organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management) does not do justice to the point that Knowledge you can't measure. When knowledge is communicated, at this point it turn into informaiton and then it can be measured in some ways.

You call out knowledge as a subset of information and superset of data. Here is my take on this subject:
Knowledge is whats trapped in something. So you can say that person has lots of knowledge, you can't get it off them easily, but they can give you some "data" as a form of communication, which you can evaluate to see if it matches to the data that you have. Same applies to organisations. 
A concept of information further description of the structure of data in term of its context, when you find data valuable, you say that was useful information, as its structure was able to link to your structure.
Data is the lowest level of structure that does not have any context.
Based on this, you can look at all activities in social-process is to extract and capture data from people with context. This is the process of converting knowledge into information and data, to make sure it all lands properly having a meta-model is important as it will allow data to be consistent.

More on your Ripose perspective:
Objectives - Goals (Purpose, Benefit, Values) and Measures great there are a few more areas that could be included
Knowledge is a connector and refers to the act of persisting knowledge into a meta-model.
Strategies - its the implementation of objectives how it's going to be done. I think Business/IT separation is in conflict.
Prototype - prototyping if not done properly, will cause bad solutions to be left in operation that a proven concept. Essentially it should be part of the plans and solution definition to deliver an MVP.
Solutions - essentially an implementation of strategies, would be possibly generated by the system once it has enough detail.
Change -  is the release and application of solution into the organisation.
From a high level, you cover the aspect of planning a change and then implement it into the organisation. This is a similar approach that all frameworks take, top-down planning and implementing. Your 1-4-11 provide scope for focus so that people get to the point what they really need.

Quick glance on the Caspar meta-model:
Conceptual  - these are all about driving to alignment to value.
Goals
Measures - measure for a goal? What about the measure for outputs?
Knowledge - is all of the conceptual data in the model?
Strategies - 
Tactics - implements strategies
Logical - these are all about the physical structure
Facts - models of data and its trust levels?
Databases - this is a just the data store for an application, its interacted to via applications?
Process - does this represent business process across capabilities?
Application - these are technical systems that people use.

Is compiler refers to Caspar converting its knowledge into PDF, how does someone interact with data in Caspar? Who can interact with Caspar?

Let me know if I've missed some documents.
