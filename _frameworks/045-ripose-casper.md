## Description

The Ripose technique enables the rapid clarification of your organization's objectives, knowledge and strategies by helping you identify, document and manage three types of information - explicit, tacit and hidden.

Ripose provides the perspective for social-process, and Caspar provides a tool that matches Ripose model with some additional meta-model. Other frameworks provide a process and rely on other tools such as Archimate to do some of it. Some tools have additional analytical functions but that as far as it goes at the moment.

Ripose/Caspar is an information system into which you enter a bunch of information, and it creates a report for consumption. Caspar compiler is a database that contains all of the infromation captured using Ripose cycles. Capert is the application logic layer that implements the Ripose process perspective. Casper has predefined information model that is used as a base for analysis.

### Ripose perspectives

This framworks uses two stages for delivery Planning and Delivery.

* Planning - all relevant information is added to a tool
  * Objectives - Goals (Purpose, Benefit, Values) and Measures great there are a few more areas that could be included
    * Knowledge is a connector and refers to the act of persisting knowledge into a meta-model.
  * Strategies - its the implementation of objectives how it's going to be done. I think Business/IT separation is in conflict.
    * Prototype - prototyping if not done properly, will cause bad solutions to be left in operation that a proven concept. Essentially it should be part of the plans and solution definition to deliver an MVP.
* Delivery - once plans a are evaluted in the tool then they are executed
  * Solutions - essentially an implementation of strategies, would be possibly generated by the system once it has enough detail.
  * Change - change managment activities with organisations

### Casper Meta-model

This is the meta model in the database, its used to drive all planning knowledge gathering. This is top down hierarchy and is essentialy a database schema.

* Conceptual  - these are all about driving to alignment to value.
* Goals - listing of goals as per Goals (Purpose, Benefit, Values) and Measures
* Measures - measure for a goal? What about the measure for outputs?
* Knowledge - is all of the conceptual data in the model?
* Strategies - meta for strategies
* Tactics - implements strategies
* Logical - these are all about the physical structure
* Facts - models of data and its trust levels?
* Databases - this is a just the data store for an application, its interacted to via applications?
* Process - does this represent business process across capabilities?
* Application - these are technical systems that people use.

## Artifacts

* [TheRightAndWrongWays.pdf](/assets/frameworks/ripose/TheRightAndWrongWays.pdf) - Extensive demonstration of mapping Ripose to other frameworks and highlight the number of differences.

* [KnowledgeManagement.pdf](/assets/frameworks/ripose/KnowledgeManagement.pdf) - Knowledge as a subset of information and superset of data. Even this explanation [Knowledge management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information of an organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management) does not do justice to the point that Knowledge you can't measure. When knowledge is communicated, at this point it turn into informaiton and then it can be measured in some ways.
