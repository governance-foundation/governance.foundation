## Description

Unified Architecture Framework - UAFP 1.0 supports the capability to:

- model architectures for a broad range of complex systems, which may include hardware, software, data, personnel, and facility elements;
- model consistent architectures for system-of-systems (SoS) down to lower levels of design and implementation;
- support the analysis, specification, design, and verification of complex systems; and
- improve the ability to exchange architecture information among related tools that are SysML based and tools that are based on other standards.

The intent of UAF is to provide a standard representation for describing enterprise architectures using a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach.
