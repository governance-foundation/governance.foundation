## Description

A quick start toolkit necessary to begin and sustain an Enterprise Architecture.

## Artifacts

* [The Pragmatic Family of Frameworks](/assets/frameworks/pragmaticea/PF2.pdf)
  * A frmework for conceptualising and scoring enterpise.
  * Applies scoring methodology and uses MS Office products for enabling tools.
  * Primarily focused at managment.
  * Lots of anecdotal evidence.
  * Lots of uncomfortable trade marking making this it questionable read.
  * Styling...
  * Transtion from horozontal silos Business and IT to Capability Silos.
  * Lobbying concept aims at leveraging general feedback loop that exist in [governance paradigm](/governance/paradigm) and ensure that it can be explicitly tarcked. Fundementaly this trying additional imput into managment practices for potential change, this does seem as a self reporting concepts in this framework.
  * Core concepts cover traditional SDLC, Operations and Strategic Alignment livecycles.
  * Influenced by Deming's (GE) methodology and Zachman v3.
* [The Pragmatic Enterprise Architecture Framework](/assets/frameworks/pragmaticea/PEAF.pdf)
  * Overal Process maps to Artifact liniage. Process and Artifact liniage is syimilar to traditional SDLC and artifact output and would be considered heavy in agile organisations. More time is allocated to "Design" phase.
  * Exception handling is handled with Waver concept.
  * Affirms culture of IT vs Business, does not cover premise that IT is Business and without technology businesses would not operate efficiently.
  * "IT should never say NO, if should say yes, BUT" does not answer the premise that IT is the extention of business and should not be put into a divicive proposition.
  * Culture covers organisational hierarchy, management and functional involvement.
  * Provides a model for framework comparison criteria.
  * Good Adoption Measure metrics.
  * Communication and knowledge transfer are keys to maturity.
  * Good layout for Adoption Actions that applies to most frameworks.
