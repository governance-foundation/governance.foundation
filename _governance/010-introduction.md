## Summary

Governance described and detailed as a conceptual perspective of a particular domain and its context, it’s aimed at unambiguously conveying a context of an entity within its domain that contributes to its behaviour. This notion can be observed in numerous usages of the term in different context as well as in the generic all-encompassing technical nature of those terms.

The organisation is a self-organising system; it consists of interconnected social and technical sub-systems, all of these systems being influenced towards idealistic organisational purposes. Furthermore, the organisation is a social system and cannot be reduced to a simple technical model, this being contrary to the aim of establishing governance definition.

In the context of an organisation, governance is a perspective of an organisation. This perspective is perceived to provide a deterministic model of organisation, model that, in turn, can be used to forecast the behaviour of the organisation. This notion can be observed in the form of persistent attempts to leverage the term in domains where it’s applied.  Numerous exhaustive efforts to leverage governance have led to the development of technical control mechanisms that are sought for replication in order to achieve predictable outcomes by organisations in all spheres of society.

The paradox of these mechanical or technical control mechanisms is their nature as persisted repeatable social patterns of behaviours or as defined by (Hufty, 2009) as institutionalised norms. This fundamental nature predicts their ability to apply in a different social context. The ability to use these mechanisms in a social setting is dependent on social context accepting the pattern of behaviour prescribed. Employing a particular prescribed pattern of behaviour in an incompatible social context causes exceptions; these exceptions can be observed in many failures of applying prescribed practice in companies, institutions and countries. As the existence of those social organisations demonstrates that ultimately they are already aligned to the external environment, this being due to their self-organisation nature.

Fundamentally this paradox demonstrates to us that even in the absence of clear governance definition, social contexts continue to operate, and if the governance is the guiding principle, then those social contexts are being led by an invisible hand. Although proponents of governance would stipulate that governance awareness would constitute measurable benefit, those social contexts already have all the required stimulation for existence. Axiom being that an existing organisation has governance.

## Governance Origin

The term 'governance' has fallen into disuse (Hufty, 2009), it originates from a Greek verb 'kubernân' which refers to the verb 'pilot' (Oliveira, 2003) in reference to 'pilot a ship'. The Greek term subsequently gave birth to the Latin verb 'gubernare' of similar meaning; its derivative 'gubernantia', in turn, gave birth to other words in many languages, including English and French (Oliveira, 2003). In the middle ages, the French term gouvernance was subjected to multiple meanings, the most prevalent, and the term that was passed on into English being 'the art' or 'way of governing' (Oliveira, 2003).

The evolution tree depicted in Figure 1 demonstrates the evolution of the term from its origins as a Greek verb, through to its present accepted representation as a noun. The original word described 'the act of controlling a ship' by an individual (to pilot), this evolved into the term governance that refers to a model that describes the scope of 'govern' action, making a more generic non-subjective term. Despite the vague historical evolution of the word, it is clear that development of the word was driven by the need for a word that conveys a generic action of influencing control and rather than controlling. It can be observed, that at least logically this makes sense, as the usage of the term in govern an individual opposed to controlling an individual would provide an opportunity to explore other factors, i.e. other actions that limit individuals free will to reject control.

## Governance Paradigm

The Greek reference to the term governance and its subsequent translations are not conclusive to the exact meaning of the term. Attempts at distinction, although evident in subsequent translations, are not authoritative due to lack of consistency in the definitions. A prominent distinction was made by Plato who used the term to describe the act of governing men (Hufty, 2009; Oliveira, 2003), despite also being a translation, it demonstrated that the term is generic and can be applied in different contexts. 

Furthermore, it can be observed that Plato’s application of the term, and its relative era of usage in relation to the origin of the word, have significant authority over more recent applications. Martin (2009) insist that governance as a synonym of controlling and essence of its paradigm lies in an authority that monitors and makes necessary adjustments to the systems. They generalise the governance paradigm in three fundamental assumptions:

1. There is a target system that interacts with the environment.
2. The target system requires to be governed, and
3. A governing system does the actual governing.

Additionally, these three assumptions generalise the relationships between systems as input and output interactions, and emphasise the explicit usage of term system, systems and their interactions are defined in Governance Paradigm Foundation:

Martin (2009) explicit usage of term system enforces a structured approach to defining elements and their interactions (Martin, 2009). Governance is generalisable (Hufty, 2009), and this framework provides a comprehensive and generic foundation that can be used to build a technical perspective through its application. The approach taken by Martin (2009) is based on their targeted use of the term governance as a controlling mechanism that influences authoritative forces on a target system.

Interestingly the model by Martin (2009) that proposes the function of governance in a distinct governance system is in contrast to Hufty’s conclusion that governance is a social fact (Hufty, 2009). Hufty defines governance concept as a category of social facts, or a subject of study and suggests that “it refers to a process of interactions between actors involved in a collective issue that lead to decisions and the formulation of social norms” (Hufty, 2009). Although the framework defined by Martin (2009) does accommodate the definition of interactions between actors, it does not accommodate the importance of social factors identified by Hufty (Hufty, 2009).

Clearly, this unique perspective of governance deviates from current reductionist and mechanic paradigm and focuses more on the social aspect of social organisation. Furthermore, this deviation fundamentally changes the perspective from enforcing structure to facilitating the process through the structure, this allowing social organisation ability to self-organise.

## Governance Evolution

The evolution of the term governance in its many perspectives is being driven by the need to establish a predictive and repeatable governance norm. Efforts at clarification to date have been a multitude of disparate normative and prescriptive frameworks, and a governance norm still does not exist despite the unprecedented dedication of research to the concept (Hufty, 2009). 

Although the development of patterns, mechanisms, standards and definitions are supported by pragmatic experimentation involving the implementation of these concepts in a mixture of sophisticated frameworks, observations may be contrary to Governance concept fundamentals. In fact, according to Hufty, Governance is not a normative or a prescriptive concept; it is a fundamental social fact that has characteristics which can be analysed and interpreted (Hufty, 2009).  Therefore the evolution of governance into forms of normative and prescriptive frameworks is contrary to the governance concept and these frameworks should be products of governance analysis and be part of a wider range of governance functions (Balloni & Bermejo, 2010).
