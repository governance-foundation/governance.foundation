Despite having no universal definition for the term governance, governance concept is used as a perspective in many fields (Hufty, 2009). This section will highlight some of the existing perspectives of governance, all of which are well-known governance concepts describing governance at different levels of society.

Although these perspectives could be a result of reductionist, atomistic thinking, they are endemic views in practice and academia (Balloni & Bermejo, 2010). These perspectives provide insight into the fundamental nature of governance as a generic concept and are important for building a sympathetic comprehension of the existing application of the term.

Following sections detail some of the available and used govenrance concepts.
