A framework is an aggregation of knowledge, its a mechanism for converting knowledge into a repeatable pattern, productising knowledge and turning into a commodity product. A Framework aims to provide a way to make knowledge portable and accessible in a way that enables others without the immediate need to understand the underlying structure. 

Any given framework would typically provide a quicks pathway to adoption as to aid framework adoption. Additionally, it would provide a level of educational opportunities that would enable users to achieve better understanding and provide the skill to tailor the framework as needed.

## Knowledge Icebergs

Aggregated nature of a framework means that it's an iceberg of knowledge, and it represents the cumulative knowledge it's author's as well as knowledge of giants on which shoulders those authors stood. These knowledge icebergs if not approached correctly, will seal your faith which is an unfortunate nature of the unknown.

Organisations are also icebergs of knowledge and represent the cumulative knowledge of all their participants, the more brilliant they appear, the more knowledge and data-hungry they are. Organisations leverage a multitude of structural societal frameworks and employ humans to add value and help to deal with exceptions. This means that essentially organisation leverages societal structures to achieve an exception that would be mutually beneficial.

Let's explore these concepts further when a new employee joins an organisation they bring with them a wealth of experience and unique perspective that is mutually helpful when integrated. This integration occurs slowly, which is the primary reason for success, as both organisation and employee explore alignment between their knowledge structures and have time to adjust. The best outcome is when both employee and organisational knowledge structures are similar and align without exceptions. 

Knowledge structure alignment exceptions occur when either of the structures does not align cleanly and in all cases employee would be in a position to decide their actions. An employee can either use their influence to alter the organisations or strive for other goals. Most mutually beneficial goals are when employees choose to influence the organisation as it provides growth not only to employee and organisation but also for other employees within the organisation.

The scope and incentives of the initiative by the employee mean that the alignment of changes would either be local or organisation-wide, and though this process moulding and enriching of both knowledge structures occur. Throughout this process, the employee plays the role of a change agent whose incentive is to ensure the framework and their knowledge is tightly integrated into the organisation. This, in essence, provides a way for an employee to leave an imprint on the organisational knowledge structure.

When it comes to aligning frameworks to organisations, essentially the same process occurs. The biggest difference in alignment of a framework to an organisation comes from the scope of impact and implementation timelines. The scope of impact for framework tend to always be organisation-wide, even if they are appear localised 

When joining an organisation and a framework for the purpose of achieving a goal, great care needs to be taken. This means that careful analysis of all parts of the organisation and a frameworks needs occur before an approach can be formulated.

Icebergs can connect together and look like they fit at the top...
