## Knowledge Icebergs

All organisations are socio-technical in nature; this means that all frameworks do, is to provide a perspective on the process that can influence social-process that then would drive an adjustment in the structure of that organisation. Additionally, they can provide a perspective for cognitive models that educate everyone on how they should coordinate their information exchange.

Frameworks provide a defined process perspective and rely on other tools and processes within organisaiton to be a used for further analysis. Fundemntaly relying providiung a structure to humans and letting them use that to drive further thinking. Some of the tools that can be implmented part of this process have additional analytical functions but that as far as it has got to at the moment. These tools become a location for modeling and persising knowledge and essentialy provide support to humans in thier knowledge worker capacity.


Frameworks provide a process and rely on other tools such as Archimate to do some of it. Some tools have additional analytical functions but that as far as it goes at the moment. 

Fundamentally all the frameworks articulate is:
follow this social-process, and  
convert knowledge into information that can be used for further analysis

This looks great on paper, and in reality, the results of applying these frameworks vary as expected. The primary reason for this is that any given framework is an iceberg of knowledge with which the organisation collides for the purpose of joining into one whole. This means that all levels all knowledge has to transfer equally to ensure this symbiosis. The simplest example of this is like a zipper, framework on one side and organisation on the other. Most organisations start at the top, and they get the zipper aligned well at the top, and as you go down at some point, it stops working, and the whole thing is rejected. And it does not matter how amazing the framework is all it takes is one bad tooth to stop progress.


## Organisational Knowledge

Knowledge is whats trapped in something. So you can say that person has lots of knowledge, you can't get it off them easily, but they can give you some "data" as a form of communication, which you can evaluate to see if it matches to the data that you have. Same applies to organisations.

A concept of information further description of the structure of data in term of its context, when you find data valuable, you say that was useful information, as its structure was able to link to your structure.

Data is the lowest level of structure that does not have any context.

Based on this, you can look at all activities in an organisation as a social-process to extract and capture data from people with its context. This is the process of converting knowledge into information and data, to make sure it all lands properly having a meta-model is important as it will allow data to be consistent. Even when you sell a products you are essentialy selling knowledge of your organisation.

## Information as a Side-hustles

In an organisation  information in these tools usualy a side hastle for people who are doing.
