In organisations miscommunication is pathological, and it is prevalent in all types of socio-technical organisations startups, government and corporates. The primary reason for this is audience conflict, where teams loyalty at lower levels often erode its ability to deal with external ideas, other groups and its allegiance to the organisation as a whole. 

These organisational communication issues further amplified by scale and velocity at which an organisation tries to move. In an organisation, geographic, corporate, and domain silos provide a ground on which miscommunication impeds communication and collaboration.

Socio-technical organisations need to promote empathy in an organisation that allows teams to respect each other's contributions as well as maintain the shared purpose of organisational goal. Organisations that enable teams to embrace the shared language and establish mutual regard towards other groups would develop organisational cohesion that will further reinforce organisational success.

Significant social issues in organisations that impact performance fall into the following categories:

* Communication - ability to communicate effectively without translation errors, without shared data and language this becomes impossible and impacts collaboration.
* Collaboration - the ability to share resources, teams ability to share their resources and allow other teams contribution impacts cooperation.
* Cooperation - ability to help each other, teams abilities to provide support to other groups when required by teams impacts coordination.
* Coordination - ability to coordinate the effort across teams and time in pursuit of organisational goals depend on teams in that organisation to be able to communicate, collaborate and cooperate. 

One of the apporaches to deal with social issues is to encourage cohesion across team. For organisations to establish organisational cohesion, all participants need to feel that their contribution is valuable and equally important. This can be achieved by providing tailored experience at the team level, in turn, enabling teams to achieve their goals while ensuring that all groups are working off the same shared knowledge. Establishing a shared knowledge base and providing tailored experiences for groups creates a common purpose, facilitates communication and enables cooperation, all of this enabling coordination across the organisation.

Organisations are socio-technical platforms that attempt to facilitate socially driven change to technical systems created by that organisation. Coordinating social change has become difficult to achieve without shared knowledge, that can be adopted and tailored though experiences for individuals that make up those organisations. By doing this, organisations will provide a method that will ensure that everyone involved feels that their contribution is valued and is equally important.

Establishing a shared knowledge that whole organisation use as a base for decisions requires a new type of governance platform. A new governance platform that will provide a foundation for defining governance models so that they can be leveraged by AI to provide direction and insights while maintaining human social participation. This platform will provide a central core to each organisation and will support all interactions across organisations and will enable orchestration of organisational systems and will enhance social participation.

The case for a new governance plafrom is all to apparent across all idustries and social divides. Oldways of doing things in organisations can't keep up with breadth, depth and scale of new age demands. Complexity of organisational dependecies, social ways of working and technology create foundation for unpredictable delivery.  Ability to get a message across in organisations and deliver on that message is a hampered by sheer amount of noise.

Governance Experience Platform (GXP) is a platform that enables the development of Organisational Experiences that leverage foundational knowledge and structures that self-reinforces its foundations. GXP is a platform that will provide the foundations on which organisations can create organisational experiences that harness the shared knowledge into a shared data structure that further reinforce organisations foundations. 

Organisations need to be able to create experiences that are efficient, effective and personalised to an individual level, crossing domain, organisational and geographic boundaries. GXP focus is to provide a foundation for creating experiences that facilitate social and procedural governance patterns, that can demonstrate and elevate the contribution of each individual to the social organisation journey.

Furthermore, humanity needs a way to share governance models from small businesses and communities to conglomerates and countries. Current methods of sharing governance models rest on ad hoc consumer-driven approach. The breadth of governance landscape prevents correlation between governance models at any level. GXP will provide a mechanism to share organisational experiences across boundaries without compromising shared knowledge of those organisations.

GXP will enable not only organisational governance but will also provide a pathway to establish trusted relationships with governments that provide stewardship in shared societal responsibilities with organisations.
