These frameworks are listed in no particular order and are here as a reference a testament to the knowledge that people behind these frameworks have created.   From modelling perspective review of existing models and frameworks is done to elicit their essential cognitive models and leveraging their ideas to develop the ontology model. This model will be used to teach synthetic intelligence system what it needs to be able to understand an organisation using that model.   Educating a synthetic intelligence system follows the same process as teaching a person, its a process of enabling the understanding of what sort of information should be of interest about an organisation to describe it in its entirety. This information then would be used to help to provide additional input to the organisation.

Ripose provides the perspective for social-process, and Caspar provides a tool that matches Ripose model with some additional meta-model. Other frameworks provide a process and rely on other tools such as Archimate to do some of it. Some tools have additional analytical functions but that as far as it goes at the moment.   Ripose/Caspar is an information system into which you enter a bunch of information, and it creates a report for consumption. Caspar compiler is a database that contains all of the infromation captured using Ripose cycles. Capert is the application logic layer that implements the Ripose process perspective. Casper has predefined information model that is used as a base for analysis.   Ripose perspectives   This framworks uses two stages for delivery Planning and Delivery.

        "excerpt":"              On This Page     What is Governance   Terms           The System       The Social Self-organisation       The Organisation       The Information System                     What is Governance   Governance described and detailed as a conceptual perspective of a particular domain and its context, it’s aimed at unambiguously conveying a context of an entity within its domain that contributes to its behaviour. This notion can be observed in numerous usages of the term in different context as well as in the generic all-encompassing technical nature of those terms.   The organisation is a self-organising system; it consists of interconnected social and technical sub-systems, all of these systems being influenced towards idealistic organisational purposes. Furthermore, the organisation is a social system and cannot be reduced to a simple technical model, this being contrary to the aim of establishing governance definition.   In the context of an organisation, governance is a perspective of an organisation. This perspective is perceived to provide a deterministic model of organisation, model that, in turn, can be used to forecast the behaviour of the organisation. This notion can be observed in the form of persistent attempts to leverage the term in domains where it’s applied.  Numerous exhaustive efforts to leverage governance have led to the development of technical control mechanisms that are sought for replication in order to achieve predictable outcomes by organisations in all spheres of society.   The paradox of these mechanical or technical control mechanisms is their nature as persisted repeatable social patterns of behaviours or as defined by (Hufty, 2009) as institutionalised norms. This fundamental nature predicts their ability to apply in a different social context. The ability to use these mechanisms in a social setting is dependent on social context accepting the pattern of behaviour prescribed. Employing a particular prescribed pattern of behaviour in an incompatible social context causes exceptions; these exceptions can be observed in many failures of applying prescribed practice in companies, institutions and countries. As the existence of those social organisations demonstrates that ultimately they are already aligned to the external environment, this being due to their self-organisation nature.   Fundamentally this paradox demonstrates to us that even in the absence of clear governance definition, social contexts continue to operate, and if the governance is the guiding principle, then those social contexts are being led by an invisible hand. Although proponents of governance would stipulate that governance awareness would constitute measurable benefit, those social contexts already have all the required stimulation for existence. Axiom being that an existing organisation has governance.   Terms   Following are terms that are used in conjunction when discussing governance a sympathetic comprehension of these terms would suffice for initial understanding.   The System   A general systems theory provides us with a notion of a “system”, this term system is defined as an arrangement of interacting objects, material or ideal nature, and is distinguishable from its environmet (Klauninger, 2001). The distinction here being that material objects is more predictable in their behaviour than ideal objects due to human cognition and free will (Klauninger, 2001; Fuchs, 2003). For example, a rock is a material system with predictable behaviour and a human, although being enslaved to the same physics laws as a rock has free will that gives freedom of behaviour. This definition is important as it enables forming a high-level context of a subject without a requirement to account constituting components.   The Social Self-organisation   Sociological theories provide us with a concept of social self-organisation, referring to the upper level of a hierarchy of a system, where individuals exercise freedom of conscious creation. This making social self-organisation unique in a structural sense as it involves permanent (re-)creation of new structures that influence individual thinking and actions (Fuchs, Jan 2001). This provides a fundamental base for social organisation, as it postulates that the locus of change with the organisation is with the individuals that make up that organisation.   The Organisation   The organisation is an organisation system that has social and technical sub-systems (Balloni &amp; Bermejo, 2010). The separation of the organisational system into social and technical sub-systems is important as it separates the organisation into two notions of predictability of behaviour, technical systems being more predictable than social systems (Klauninger, 2001). Social systems are re-creative, can change, maintain, adapt, reproduce and can observe itself, and cannot be reduced to simple technical models (Fuch, 2002; Fuchs, 2001). Furthermore, social systems are self-organising and transforming systems that produce unpredictable emergent change (Millet, 1998). For example, an organisation can decide to stop operating by this effectively destroying itself, a formidable yet distant exercise for rock. This position enables us to discuss the organisation as a whole without deviating on complexities of components that make up organisations.   The Information System   All self-organising systems are information generating systems; each time a system organises itself, information is produced (Fuch, 2002). This means that organisations are information systems and individuals play a role in the generation of information in that organisation (Fuchs, Feb 2003). The role that an individual plays as the agent of change in an organisation is fundamental to organisations as information systems.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Governance Origin",
        "excerpt":"The term ‘governance’ has fallen into disuse (Hufty, 2009), it originates from a Greek verb ‘kubernân’ which refers to the verb ‘pilot’ (Oliveira, 2003) in reference to ‘pilot a ship’. The Greek term subsequently gave birth to the Latin verb ‘gubernare’ of similar meaning; its derivative ‘gubernantia’, in turn, gave birth to other words in many languages, including English and French (Oliveira, 2003). In the middle ages, the French term gouvernance was subjected to multiple meanings, the most prevalent, and the term that was passed on into English being ‘the art’ or ‘way of governing’ (Oliveira, 2003).      The evolution tree depicted above demonstrates the evolution of the term from its origins as a Greek verb, through to its present accepted representation as a noun. The original word described ‘the act of controlling a ship’ by an individual (to pilot), this evolved into the term governance that refers to a model that describes the scope of ‘govern’ action, making a more generic non-subjective term. Despite the vague historical evolution of the word, it is clear that development of the word was driven by the need for a word that conveys a generic action of influencing control and rather than controlling. It can be observed, that at least logically this makes sense, as the usage of the term in govern an individual opposed to controlling an individual would provide an opportunity to explore other factors, i.e. other actions that limit individuals free will to reject control.

        "title": "Governance Paradigm",
        "excerpt":"The Greek reference to the term governance and its subsequent translations are not conclusive to the exact meaning of the term. Attempts at distinction, although evident in subsequent translations, are not authoritative due to lack of consistency in the definitions. A prominent distinction was made by Plato who used the term to describe the act of governing men (Hufty, 2009; Oliveira, 2003), despite also being a translation, it demonstrated that the term is generic and can be applied in different contexts.   Furthermore, it can be observed that Plato’s application of the term, and its relative era of usage in relation to the origin of the word, have significant authority over more recent applications. Martin (2009) insist that governance as a synonym of controlling and essence of its paradigm lies in an authority that monitors and makes necessary adjustments to the systems. They generalise the governance paradigm in three fundamental assumptions:      There is a target system that interacts with the environment.   The target system requires to be governed, and   A governing system does the actual governing.   Additionally, these three assumptions generalise the relationships between systems as input and output interactions, and emphasise the explicit usage of term system, systems and their interactions are defined in Governance Paradigm Foundation:      Martin (2009) explicit usage of term system enforces a structured approach to defining elements and their interactions (Martin, 2009). Governance is generalisable (Hufty, 2009), and this framework provides a comprehensive and generic foundation that can be used to build a technical perspective through its application. The approach taken by Martin (2009) is based on their targeted use of the term governance as a controlling mechanism that influences authoritative forces on a target system.   Interestingly the model by Martin (2009) that proposes the function of governance in a distinct governance system is in contrast to Hufty’s conclusion that governance is a social fact (Hufty, 2009). Hufty defines governance concept as a category of social facts, or a subject of study and suggests that “it refers to a process of interactions between actors involved in a collective issue that lead to decisions and the formulation of social norms” (Hufty, 2009). Although the framework defined by Martin (2009) does accommodate the definition of interactions between actors, it does not accommodate the importance of social factors identified by Hufty (Hufty, 2009).   Clearly, this unique perspective of governance deviates from current reductionist and mechanic paradigm and focuses more on the social aspect of social organisation. Furthermore, this deviation fundamentally changes the perspective from enforcing structure to facilitating the process through the structure, this allowing social organisation ability to self-organise.

        "excerpt":"The evolution of the term governance in its many perspectives is being driven by the need to establish a predictive and repeatable governance norm. Efforts at clarification to date have been a multitude of disparate normative and prescriptive frameworks, and a governance norm still does not exist despite the unprecedented dedication of research to the concept (Hufty, 2009).   Although the development of patterns, mechanisms, standards and definitions are supported by pragmatic experimentation involving the implementation of these concepts in a mixture of sophisticated frameworks, observations may be contrary to Governance concept fundamentals. In fact, according to Hufty, Governance is not a normative or a prescriptive concept; it is a fundamental social fact that has characteristics which can be analysed and interpreted (Hufty, 2009).  Therefore the evolution of governance into forms of normative and prescriptive frameworks is contrary to the governance concept and these frameworks should be products of governance analysis and be part of a wider range of governance functions (Balloni &amp; Bermejo, 2010).

This section will highlight some of the existing perspectives of governance, all of which are well-known governance concepts describing governance at different levels of society.   Although these perspectives could be a result of reductionist, atomistic thinking, they are endemic views in practice and academia (Balloni &amp; Bermejo, 2010). These perspectives provide insight into the fundamental nature of governance as a generic concept and are important for building a sympathetic comprehension of the existing application of the term.

        "title": "Global Governance",
        "excerpt":"Hufty describes Global Governance as a concept for establishing order in international regimes (Hufty, 2009).  The concept emerged due to the absence of a supra-state entity in the international systems that could arbitrate conflict between actors. According to Hufty, the complexity in the number of participating actors and the institutionalisation of international life establishes the concept as multilevel governance (Hufty, 2009). Global governance aims to solve co-operation and decision-making problems through consensus without paying attention to relative powers in international regimes. Hufty highlights an innovative definition of governance established by the Commission on Global Governance (CGG) (Hufty, 2009).   Commission on Global Governance (CGG) defines governance as the ‘sum of the many ways individuals and institutions, public and private, manage their common affairs. It is a continuing process through which conflicting or diverse interests may be accommodated and co-operative action may be taken’. It includes formal institutions and regimes empowered to enforce compliance, as well as informal arrangements that people and institutions either have agreed to or perceive to be in their interest (Hufty, 2009).   According to Hufty, from an analytical perspective, this definition captures all relevant actors and both formal and informal agreements (Hufty, 2009). It is procedural and takes into consideration the continuous change in the relationship between actors (Hufty, 2009). However, it fails to deal with the nature of agreements reached and their suitability in solving fundamental problems (Hufty, 2009).   Considering the definition provided by Hufty from a generic perspective, it is clear that it is aimed at establishing incentives that in turn, stimulate behaviour without being prescriptive on expectations and processes. This is evident in the definition through the emphasis on the actor’s individual interest, and the co-operation process that in turn, facilitates establishing these expectations. Additionally, the scope is maintained at social relations level through the identification of all contributing formal and informal arrangement between actors without reduction to a technical system.   An observation can be made that the level at which the Commission on Global Governance operates gives the reason for their definition resembles social governance fundamentals defined by Hufty. CGG operates at the highest level of society that has an absence of higher authoritative system and thus requiring other mechanisms of social organisation. Furthermore, CGG demonstrates the capability to understand the factors and relationships that would be contributing to global governance while avoiding involvement in the many ways each individual society develops its own methods of governance.

        "title": "Modern Governance",
        "excerpt":"Modern governance refers to the concept of the State being dependant on heterarchical regulation mechanisms, caused by the loss or delegation of its power and competencies, to various local, national and international entities. This concept is used as an instrument for analysis and action, contributing to the solution of the crisis in the governance of the State (Hufty, 2009).   Hufty highlights three fundamental models of regulating society: hierarchical (by the authorities), economic (by the market) and heterarchical (by self-organised networks and associations) (Hufty, 2009). The expansion of the heterarchical model, to the detriment of others, is causing a breakdown and the apparent crisis in hierarchical rationality of the State (Hufty, 2009). Furthermore, Hufty’s analysis disputes the crisis in the governance of the State, concluding that this is a phenomenon transitioning the role of the State from the hierarchical regulator to a heterarchical facilitator, which is a solution to the crisis (Hufty, 2009).   According to Hufty, the State’s role should transition to that of a facilitator (Hufty, 2009). However, it could be argued; that the State already plays the role of facilitator. The State initiates the delegation processes and enters into arrangements with delegated entities and indirectly becomes part of a heterarchical mechanism. The awareness of the entity being part of a larger network whilst not important in the scope of an individual arrangement, it is important from a governance perspective, as it enables an understanding of the system as a whole, including an account of all interconnected systems that constitute the system.   In the absence of awareness of its position, the State finds itself unable to manoeuvre due to the complicated nature of arrangements in the hierarchical mechanism. Furthermore, considering CGG’s role as a facilitator and their definition of governance, the State would require the capability of maintaining the perspective of the system as a whole which it has clearly failed to do manifesting in a perceived crisis.

        "title": "Corporate Governance",
        "excerpt":"Recent attention of academics and practitioners on Corporate Governance has emerged due to widely publicised scandals around the world involving corporations and, in particular, the conduct of Boards of Directors in large corporations (Cross, 2004; Colley, 2005). These scandals led to the development of new regulations and legislation, the most prominent of these being the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Colley, 2005). Colley points out that the confluence of these events has focused public eye on the topic of Corporate Governance, highlighting it’s crucial importance to the capitalist and the world economy (Colley, 2005).   Recent historical scandals have raised questions as to whether the transgressions were confined to the ranks of a few renegades, or whether the wrongdoing was systemic (Colley, 2005). Ostarkov suggests that the wrongdoing is needed in the existing governance systems that have been relayed by social institutions; and have the same specific problems that those institutions were initially designed to solve (Ostarkov, 2005). Ostarkov further asserts that under existing governance systems, companies that engage in “grey” business practices possess a competitive advantage and to withdraw from the shadow would jeopardise their operations (Ostarkov, 2005).   The expression Corporate Governance has been well established in the United States since the 1970’s and refers to the system of authoritative direction or a form of representative government in the public corporation as, demonstrated by Colley(Cross, 2004; Colley, 2005). Colley describes the roots of Corporate Governance, beginning in the early days of the Industrial Revolution (Colley, 2005). At that time governance was tightened to curb individual wealth, accumulation of the greedy and unscrupulous Robber Barons (Josephson, 1934) of the time, with laws, regulations and oversight of the federal and the State governments. Colley and ITGI present a basic premise of corporate governance is apparent which it is to protect the interests of customers, employees, shareholders, other stakeholders, and the community (Colley, 2005; ITGI, 1999).   An observation can be made that Corporate Governance referred to the stimulation of corporations to exhibit behaviour that is representative of the interests of all contributing parties. The incentive was provided through laws and regulations with reassurance delivered through oversight delivered by the State. The State, as the facilitator, maintained the scope of the system as a whole and acted accordingly. As observed earlier, through the development of Modern Governance (3.2.2), the State has already failed in its role as a facilitator through its inability to maintain the scope of the system as a whole. Furthermore, the effect of this in a Corporate Governance context is the perceived wrongdoings of corporations whilst discounting evident facilitation of those actions by the State.   Several other definitions of Corporate Governance can be drawn from the literature. They all have one aspect in common, which is to place importance on the authoritative direction within an organisation.                  Definition       Analysis                       Corporate Governance is all the processes that coordinate and control an organisations resources and actions. (Meyer, 2004)       Internal structure used to direct the organisation, does not explicitly consider social aspect of the organisation or externalities, such as laws, regulations, social demographic                 Corporate Governance deals with the ways in which suppliers of finance assure themselves of getting a return on investment. (Shleifer &amp; Vishny, 1997)       Structured to ensure that suppliers of finance receive profit, could lead to anti-social behaviour within organisation where individuals consider their needs ahead of the organisation, does not consider external environment or social aspect of organisation                 Corporate Governance is the system by which companies are directed and controlled. (Cross, 2004)       Refers to an internal structure of control, organisations operate under numerous external influences that this definition does not encompass                 Corporate Governance is a system of authoritative direction or government. (Colley, 2005)       Refers to an internal structure of control, does not consider social elements of organisation           In western society a corporation plays a role of a legal entity, that is in legal term it is similar to a legal person, and as the law was designed for a physical person, its application to virtual placeholder is limited. In addition, as corporations are self-creating and in a permanent state of change, the control systems must follow suit.   Furthermore, the initial scope of corporate governance was aimed at providing external stimulus to the organisation and in turn, relying on organisations to perceive this stimulus as a signal to change. Thus, potentially a single change in an environment providing a simultaneous synchronisation of the corporation through self-organisation.   An observation should be made that all the definitions defined above of Corporate Governance, are contrary to the original scope of corporate governance. Conceived scope of corporate governance was aimed at external stimulation of corporations, and these definitions clearly diversify and target the internal scope of the organisation nor provide a position for self-organisation based external influences.

        "title": "Enterprise Governance",
        "excerpt":"ITGI used the term “Enterprise Governance” to describe a globally applicable prescribed model of organisational governance called the “Enterprise Governance Model” (ITGI, 1999). The Enterprise Governance Model was created in response to three environmental threats listed below as identified by the Information Systems Audit and Control Foundation (ISACF):      The ease with which globalisation and worldwide communications can override national boundaries.   Uncertainty as to how well financial accounting frameworks, developed to serve the post-industrial society, can be adapted to serve the needs of the information and knowledge-based entities of today.   The challenge of understanding how enterprises, including associated entities, are currently run, and how they can be governed effectively in the evolving shift to a knowledge-based society.   ITGI state that “Enterprise governance is the set of responsibilities and practices exercised by the board and executive management with the goal of providing strategic direction, ensuring that objectives are achieved, ascertaining that risks are managed appropriately and verifying that the enterprise’s resources are used responsibly” (ITGI, 2001).   Furthermore, ITGI clarifies the term “Enterprise Governance” distinguishing it as a subset of Corporate Governance by identifying that the corporate governance regulations and standards establish broad responsibilities and demand, and that board directors should exercise due diligence in their roles of setting strategy and ensuring management implements it (ITGI, 2001).   The concerns raised by ISACF are merely the internal concerns of an enterprise and are isolated to an alignment of an enterprise to a society without considering the governance of an enterprise across societies. Governance is not a prescribed model, and despite this ITGI translates concerns raised by ISACF into a globally applicable prescribed model.   An observation should be made that if governance was a prescribed model, then the ITGI model would apply, but because societies have their own governance, to which enterprises align, applying a single prescribed model to a global enterprise would inhibit this alignment.   The definition provided by ITGI further demonstrates the nature of enterprise governance concept is internal to the enterprise itself; this definition distinctly links the use of a governance perspective in negotiating interest of contributing parties. This distinction is similar to the CGG concept, which is the highest abstract use, and follows fundamental governance nature and for our purpose further demonstrates the generalisation of governance concept.

        "title": "Information Technology Governance",
        "excerpt":"The term Information Technology Governance (IT Governance), represents a functional governance model fundamental to an IT organisation. It is part of the overall corporate governance structure (Brown &amp; Grant, 2005) and applies principals similar to financial governance to IT Management (Weill &amp; Woodham, 2002).   Recently the topic of IT Governance has been attracting significant attention from academia and business management. However, despite this attention, it remains the weakest link in the overall corporation’s governance structures (Brown &amp; Grant, 2005; Trites, 2004; Huber, 2004).   Even with the continuous lip-service being paid in attempts to secure an accurate definition of IT Governance, the current definition fails to prevail from the futile exercise in semantics (Robb, 1997; Brown &amp; Grant, 2005). There are several prominent definitions of IT Governance available in literature defined in the following table.                  Definition       Analysis                       Corporate Governance is all the processes that coordinate and control an organisations resources and actions.

(Cross, 2004)       Refers to an internal structure of control, organisations operate under numerous external influences that this definition does not encompass                 Corporate Governance is a system of authoritative direction or government. (Colley, 2005)       Refers to an internal structure of control, does not consider social elements of organisation           As Van Grembergen (Van Grembergen, 2004) points out IT governance definition provided by Weill and Woodham is most promising. It is promising not only because it is going beyond aging “command and control” structure but because it does not reduce the IT governance to a technical structure and provides freedom for the unpredictability of social systems. Instead, it would appear provides a mechanism for monitoring the organisational system for information that can be further used for self-organisation. Unlike other proposed definition that resembles aging “command and control” structure that attempt to reduce social systems into simple technical structures.   Brown and Grant conclude that Weill’s definition remains consistent with earlier explanation by Boynton (Boynton, et al., 1992), in that IT governance is not concerned with location and distribution of IT resources, but rather the location, distribution and pattern of managerial responsibilities - ultimately how IT resources are applied and then implemented (Brown &amp; Grant, 2005).   The explanation of IT governance provided by Boynton concentrates on the negotiation of interests of IT usage within an organisation. Contrary to other definitions, it does not prescribe an operational framework but rather defines a model to be analysed. Furthermore, Boynton’s explanation does not isolate IT governance as a distinct concept but rather concentrates on the incentives for its appropriate use that are integrated into managerial responsibilities. This lack of distinction is innovative as it demonstrates that the responsibility for IT is not dissimilar to other managerial responsibilities within an enterprise.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Systemic Governance",
        "excerpt":"Meyer stipulates that an alternative to governance through oversight is systemic governance, implemented by replacing oversight controls with systemic controls to induce desired behaviours (Meyer, 2004). Meyer further associates the systemic controls with forces prevalent in the market economy, forces that align every business with the needs of its clients and the economy as a whole (Meyer, 2004). Systemic controls, acting in the same manner as market forces, would be adjusted within an organisation to induce desired behaviours and combined with other governance systems, would constitute systemic governance of organisations.   Meyer’s research identifies five organisational systems that constitute governance within an organisation: culture, structure, internal economy, methods and tools, and metrics and rewards (Meyer, 2004). An observation can be made that these five systems that are prevalent in organisations comprise both technical and social systems as well as implied socio-technical relationships. Although Meyer does not conclude on the significance of the socio-technical relationships (Meyer, 2004) other authors have acknowledged that they play a significant role in realising benefits within an organisation (Balloni &amp; Bermejo, 2010).   Balloni &amp; Bermajo describe a socio-technical system as a relationship between technical and social systems derived from a socio-technical approach designed to build a holistic view of technical and social systems that exist within organisations (Balloni &amp; Bermejo, 2010). The socio-technical approach is aimed at obtaining a systemic view of an organisation, including people and everything that surrounds them. The approach relies on systemic thinking, focusing on systemic risk and the performance of the system as a whole (Balloni &amp; Bermejo, 2010). An observation can be made that socio-technical approach is aimed at enabling the design of organisational systems to work in unison to produce a holistic and well-coordinated system of influences, similar to the aim of systemic governance perspective defined by Meyer (Meyer, 2004).

        "excerpt":"Copy-Paste Governance   Copy-paste governance approach does not work. This approach refers to an attempt to replicate the governance approach from one context to another. In the organisational context, this means copying/mimicking a governance pattern of another organisation.   Organisational governance patterns are evolutionary; they are outcomes of micro transformations performed by the organisation over numbers of years. They are representative of the social and technical structures as well as the evolution journey of that organisation.   Organisational governance is the historical record of the organisation evolution; it a combination of persistence and maturity of each part of the organisation over time. Thus simply copying governance pattern of an organisation in time to another organisation does not produce the same results.   Organisations are complex socio-technical organisms, and applying externally conceived governance patterns would mean that all of the parts that make up organisation would need to go through a transformation on a maturity curve that was followed by the organisation from which governance pattern being copied.   A case for Governance Foundation   Across all industries, organisations use oversight as the primary method of leadership and stewardship, and this approach is well defined by oversight governance. In summary oversight governance means that all of the corrective actions are applied post specific events; it’s a reactive command and control approach. This approach works when the central command has ample experience to deal with issues as they arise. When things get too complicated, this approach leads to failure, in best cases, adding to the command experience and allowing a clean to restart.   Across all industries, the old way of helping organisations mature is not scaling; this is primarily due to the level of complexity that has evolved in social and technical layers of organisations. Tried and tested societal patterns for managing change are tested as socio-technical complexity increases. Existing models are complex and primarily used as an oversight stewardship approach, usually as a reaction to the organisation in need of help. The situation further complicated by barriers for knowledge sharing.   A better approach would be to provide a governance foundation as a form of a scaffold for new organisations so that as they evolve, they unlock and leverage parts of the framework that matches their maturity. This approach would provide a mechanism that would minimise routine transformations that are influence organisations of today.   Furthermore, this approach would provide a method of sharing and leveraging knowledge across organisations, as well as provide a central holistic knowledge area for contributors to focus their attention without creating unnecessary deviations. At the same time providing a platform for sharing patterns and maintaining the visibility of contribution by the authors.  ","categories": ["foundation"],

        "excerpt":"              On This Page     Pathology of Organisational Miscommunication   Sharing Knowledge in Socio-Technical Organisations   Organisational Deafness   Governance Reborn   Beyond Governance             There is a clear need for a new way to help to govern organisations. This need is apparent from the continual search for efficiencies and effectiveness of organisations which demonstrated through transformations and a smorgasbord of frameworks available.   Existing patterns and frameworks focus on educating individual parts of the organisation in order to mature the organisation as a whole. Primarily this education efforts usually occur at a point in time where an organisation needs a boost to mature past current state. These education efforts are an oversight approach when applied and practised produces the desired outcome.   Fundamentally all organisations are socio-technical entities and at their very nature are very complicated at best. Maturing organisations is a process for developing the social and technical layers; this requires architecting and communicating of change across the organisation and its where the challenges start.   Pathology of Organisational Miscommunication   In organisations miscommunication is pathological, and it is prevalent in all types of socio-technical organisations startups, government and corporates. The primary reason for this is audience conflict, where teams loyalty at lower levels often erode its ability to deal with external ideas, other groups and its allegiance to the organisation as a whole.   These organisational communication issues further amplified by scale and velocity at which an organisation tries to move. In an organisation, geographic, corporate, and domain silos provide a ground on which miscommunication impeds communication and collaboration.   Socio-technical organisations need to promote empathy in an organisation that allows teams to respect each other’s contributions as well as maintain the shared purpose of organisational goal. Organisations that enable teams to embrace the shared language and establish mutual regard towards other groups would develop organisational cohesion that will further reinforce organisational success.   Significant social issues in organisations that impact performance fall into the following categories:      Communication - ability to communicate effectively without translation errors, without shared data and language this becomes impossible and impacts collaboration.   Collaboration - the ability to share resources, teams ability to share their resources and allow other teams contribution impacts cooperation.   Cooperation - ability to help each other, teams abilities to provide support to other groups when required by teams impacts coordination.   Coordination - ability to coordinate the effort across teams and time in pursuit of organisational goals depend on teams in that organisation to be able to communicate, collaborate and cooperate.   One of the approaches to deal with social issues is to encourage cohesion across teams. For organisations to establish organisational cohesion, all participants need to feel that their contribution is valuable and equally important. Enabling valuable contribution can be achieved by providing tailored experience at the team level, in turn, enabling teams to achieve their goals while ensuring that all groups are working off the same shared knowledge. Establishing a shared knowledge base and providing tailored experiences for groups creates a common purpose, facilitates communication and enables cooperation, all of this enabling coordination across the organisation.   Sharing Knowledge in Socio-Technical Organisations   Organisations are socio-technical platforms that attempt to facilitate socially driven change to technical systems created by the evolution of that organisation. Coordinating social change has become difficult to achieve without shared knowledge, that can be adopted and tailored though experiences for individuals that make up those organisations. By doing this, organisations will provide a method that will ensure that everyone involved feels that their contribution is valued and is equally important.   Establishing a shared knowledge that whole organisation use as a base for decisions requires a new type of governance platform. A new governance platform that will provide a foundation for defining governance models so that they can be leveraged by AI to provide direction and insights while maintaining human social participation. This platform will provide a central core to each organisation and will support all interactions across organisations and will enable orchestration of organisational systems and will enhance social participation.   Organisational Deafness   Organisational complexity creates a paradox of organisational deafness, where the sheer amount of noise drowns individual ability to get a message heard, let alone have that message make an impact. This primarily because organisations are unable to listen and engage with all inputs to that organisation. This further eventuates the paradox leads to organisations to adopt the path of less resistance approach though out its delivery.   Forces that bring about change to an organisation are both external and internal. External forces bring about changes that an organisation is unable to control, and it relies on its social ecosystem to predict and counter all external effects. Organisational internal social ecosystem translates external input and converts these into internalising actions that adjust organisational structures—the more efficient this process, the more effective the organisation as a whole.   Organisations internal social ecosystem efficiency is coupled with the effectiveness of that organisation; therefore, organisations that focus on the health of their social ecosystem would see positive outcomes for the organisation as a whole. The ability of an organisational social ecosystem to actively listen and synchronise changes needed to the organisation is largely rendered impractical due to the complexity of organisations. This leaves a minority of inputs that are leveraged for establishing a direction for change.   The ability of an organisation to actively listen and act on all inputs would provide a method to synchronise changes need to achieve effectiveness.   Governance Reborn   The case for a new governance platform is all too apparent across all industries and social divides. Oldways of doing things within organisations cannot keep up with breadth, depth and scale of new age demands. The complexity of organisational dependencies, social ways of working and technology ecosystems create a foundation for unpredictable delivery.   Governance Experience Platform (GXP) is a platform that enables the development of Organisational Experiences that leverage foundational knowledge and structures that self-reinforces its foundations. GXP is a platform that will provide the foundations on which organisations can create organisational experiences that harness the shared knowledge into a shared data structure that further reinforce organisations foundations.   Organisations need to be able to create experiences that are efficient, effective and personalised to an individual level, crossing domain, organisational and geographic boundaries. GXP focus is to provide a foundation for creating experiences that facilitate social and procedural governance patterns, that can demonstrate and elevate the contribution of each individual to the social organisation journey.   Beyond Governance   Humanity needs a way to share governance models from small businesses and communities to conglomerates and countries. Current methods of sharing governance models rest on ad hoc consumer-driven approach. The breadth of governance landscape prevents correlation between governance models at any level. GXP will provide a mechanism to share organisational experiences across boundaries without compromising shared knowledge of those organisations.   GXP will enable organisational governance and provide a pathway to establish trusted relationships with governments that provide stewardship in shared societal responsibilities with organisations. Establishing a non-invasive pathway for governments to contribute to organisational governance would facilitate cohesion between organisations without removing the free-market competition fundamentals that drive economies where those organisations operate.

        "title": "Why Frameworks Fail?",
        "excerpt":"A framework is an aggregation of knowledge, its a mechanism for converting knowledge into a repeatable pattern, productising knowledge and turning into a commodity product. A Framework aims to provide a way to make knowledge portable and accessible in a way that enables others without the immediate need to understand the underlying structure.   Any given framework would typically provide a quicks pathway to adoption as to aid framework adoption. Additionally, it would provide a level of educational opportunities that would enable users to achieve better understanding and provide the skill to tailor the Framework as needed.   Some of the reasons why frameworks fail:      Organisation and Framework icebergs are not understood   Organisation and Framework were not aligned   The social factors for rejection   Information governance as a Side-hustle   Let’s discuss these in some detail.   Knowledge Icebergs   Aggregated nature of a framework means that it’s an iceberg of knowledge, and it represents the cumulative knowledge it’s author’s as well as knowledge of giants on which shoulders those authors stood. These knowledge icebergs if not approached correctly, will seal your faith which is an unfortunate nature of the unknown.   Organisations are also icebergs of knowledge and represent the cumulative knowledge of all their participants, and the more brilliant they appear, the more knowledge and data-hungry they are. Organisations leverage a multitude of structural societal frameworks and employ humans to add value and help to deal with exceptions. This means that essentially organisation leverages societal structures to achieve an exception that would be mutually beneficial.   Let’s explore these concepts further when a new employee joins an organisation they bring with them a wealth of experience and unique perspective that is mutually helpful when integrated. This integration occurs slowly, which is the primary reason for success, as both organisation and employee explore alignment between their knowledge structures and have time to adjust. The best outcome is when both employee and organisational knowledge structures are similar and align without exceptions.   Organisational Rejection   Knowledge structure alignment exceptions occur when either of the structures does not align cleanly and in all cases employee would be in a position to decide their actions. An employee can either use their influence to alter the organisations or strive for other goals. Most mutually beneficial goals are when employees choose to influence the organisation as it provides growth not only to employee and organisation but also for other employees within the organisation.   The scope and incentives of the initiative by the employee mean that the alignment of changes would either be local or organisation-wide, and though this process moulding and enriching of both knowledge structures occur. Throughout this process, the employee plays the role of a change agent whose incentive is to ensure the Framework and their knowledge is tightly integrated into the organisation. This, in essence, provides a way for an employee to leave an imprint on the organisational knowledge structure.   When it comes to aligning frameworks to organisations, essentially the same process occurs. The biggest difference in alignment of a framework to an organisation comes from the scope of impact and implementation timelines. The scope of impact for Framework tends to always be organisation-wide, even if they are appear localised appreciation of the Framework and its purpose needs support from adjacent participants as in to support and encourage the change efforts.   To join an organisation and a framework as knowledge icebergs intimate of both has to occur to ensure close alignment, any areas that don’t align would create tension and friction that would long term reverse the alignment and organisation would reject the Framework. This is not a negative outcome as it would allow the organisation to grow and understand what in fact does not work so that the organisation can align to something that does.   Social Factors   In the majority of situations, the rejection is done at a social level as frameworks tend to prescribe a particular operational method. Technical systems can cause failures in operation models, but those reasons explicit, structurally evident and have a degree of predictability. Failures that stem from social rejection are much harder to identify, evaluate and predict. Passive aversion towards change is a catalyst for the slow erosion of progress, its undetectable until its too late and even in the retrospective are hard to identify.   The structural systems of an organisation once they are established do not have an ability self-change, social layer, on the other hand, is in a constant state of change. Within an organisation, the social layer is the sole mechanisms for dealing with the unknown and adjusting organisational structures to fit. This means attempts to introduce any frameworks into an organisation would need tangible social reasons for all participants.   Information Governance as a Side-hustle   Typically in an organisation, maintaining information is a role dedicated to a set of specialised roles that act as eyes and ears for the organisation, these roles are typically the translators between groups of people. Job for the roles that do translation is to package the knowledge and information from one side and make it relevant to another side and vice versa. These roles are typically supported with specific tools and enable some collaboration and presentation of their content to the greater community. These tools are either formal modelling suites that require foundational training and specialisation to use or could be a collection of ad-hoc material compiled overtime to provide input in a social context.   Even when roles are formally incentivised to maintain quality of information and data, they are still dependant on the organisational capacity to produce quality data that can be used as-is without translation. In the absence of that those roles are left extending the knowledge gap by filling in the blank, this done from conceptual, logical, exception handling and social where its no new reusable information is created.   Extending incentives beyond central authority in organisations are not feasible as it distracts others from their core activities. Furthermore, any form of generating and maintaining non-social information silos outside of main control function becomes a form of side-hustle. It’s it a hard job to manage information without the support, and it’s just easier to create social process gates to avoid the hassle.   Conclusion   These and other factors place an organisation future at the mercy of social consequence, where its social selection of people that help along the journey defines its success. There is no quick solution; it means that organisations need to be very thorough when introducing frameworks into their organisations.   Organisations are like people; their ability to understand a framework depend on their historical experience and acquired knowledge, so “uploading” framework knowledge into an organisation does not work like in the Matrix. GXP will explore this “upload” notion and how this could be possible in organisations of the future.  ","categories": ["foundation"],
